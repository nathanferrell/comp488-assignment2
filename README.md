Reflection

For this assignment, I started by creating a very basic website and then customized it by adding a random meme generator. I thought it would be fun to make the project more entertaining, and at the same time it gave me the chance to practice skills I had learned previously in Professor Hayward’s Client Side Web Development class. Adding the meme generator required integrating a simple API call and adjusting layout and styling so the memes displayed cleanly on both desktop and mobile. It helped me reinforce my understanding of JavaScript event handling and DOM manipulation in a way that went beyond the assignment’s minimum requirements.

Another part of this assignment that stood out was practicing the Git workflow. I made my local repository first and then pushed it to an empty remote repository. In the past, I had typically done the reverse — cloning an empty remote repo and then adding content before pushing changes. The clear instructions provided in this assignment were helpful in making me practice this alternative method. I can now see the value of it, since it gave me more control and a better understanding of how local and remote repos sync. I also made the mistake of copy-pasting the GitHub push instructions before committing my files, which caused an error. Fixing that reinforced the correct sequence: initialize → add → commit → push. Now I feel confident that I can repeat this workflow quickly without running into that mistake again.

Finally, using Vercel for deployment was one of the highlights. I really like the platform — it feels like an even swifter version of a tool I used before in Client Side Web Dev called Render. Once I linked my repository to Vercel, I relied on the live deployment several times to test the site. Having a real URL I could visit on both desktop and mobile made it easy to spot and fix layout adjustments, especially with the sticky footer and meme display. Overall, this assignment gave me practice with the full development and deployment cycle, from coding, to version control, to live hosting.
